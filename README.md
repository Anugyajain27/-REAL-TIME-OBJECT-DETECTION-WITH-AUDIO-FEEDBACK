# -REAL-TIME-OBJECT-DETECTION-WITH-AUDIO-FEEDBACK
 Developed a real-time object detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) v4 and OpenCV, integrated  with a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to provide verbal feedback. The application processes live video from a  webcam, detects objects, and announces them audibly to assist visually impaired individuals.
